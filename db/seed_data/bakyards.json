    "title": "UFO Crash Site Found! Inexplicable Proof That Aliens On Mars Had Spacecraft",
    "body": "While searching through some NASA archives I came across a Mars photo with a crashed disk in it. The disk is very similar to the craft that Bob Lazar worked on in Area S4. The craft I found has a thin disk edge rising up to a thicker inner area and an upper hump that is not curved but made with straight lines. I can even see windows in the Mars craft that I found. This is inexplicable proof that aliens on Mars had spacecraft. Oh, the photo is big, about 110mb so give it time to download if you are searching for this UFO crash.",

    "body": "This looks like the Kraken. I used Google ruler and it says this is 30 meters (100 feet) from head to end, but the end looks like just the mid area of a giant squid, which means it could be 60+ meters long with tentacles. That sounds like a Kraken to me. Maybe the stories about the giant monster of the deep are all true. A lot of storers are based on truths. I think we found the Kraken.

    "body": "Checking my home camera footage last night, before formatting my storage card, when I came across the attached 4 images. The object set off my camera, so it had to have been within about 45 ft. The camera only fires when an object moves, therefore this thing was hovering and moving for over 40 mins. I don't recall anything about that night, but this did co-inside with my dog acting very strangely that Wed evening (a lot of dog in the neighborhood barking that evening) It wasn't until I pulled my camera images last night (5/5/17) that I put two and two together.",
